# Analysis of Network Values by Genre

The jupyter notebook `Dracor_Genre_Analysis.ipynb` makes it possible to analyse the metadata of plays provided in [DraCor](https://dracor.org/) with the focus on the genre information provided for the plays. With the notebook you can perform analyses like the ones presented in "[Comedy vs. Tragedy: Network Values by Genre](https://dlina.github.io/Network-Values-by-Genre/)".   
You can perform the analyses on any DraCor corpus that is shipped with genre information and you are able to parameterize your analyses, e.g.
* filter which plays to want to analyse by the number of acts or by the number of characters
* set specific network values like *degree* or *size* that you want to investigate
* split the corpus into time frames to analyse the development of the selected network values by genre

Have fun experimenting!
